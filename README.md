# Project Diosa

Project Diosa is a project by ADAM RnD to develop a lightweight, lowcost quadcopter that can compete with other similarly sized UAVs on the market. This repository is dedicated to the development of the flight controller and the base station radio. Aside from general control of the drone, the system will employ ROS (Robot Operating System) and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to allow the drone to autonomously map out indoor spaces and provide the user with a 3D model of the space.
